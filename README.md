# Honours-Project-in-Computer-Science-and-Biology

This repository serves to store the programs and data used for my COMP 402 - Honours Project in Computer Science and Biology course. 

Code used to produce the 3D visualization models are located within the "3D visualization models" directory. 

Supplementary example images and videos of the morphological tracings discussed in the final project report can be found within the "Morphological neuron reconstructions" directory.
